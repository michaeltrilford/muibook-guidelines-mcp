  content: `# Muibook Guidelines: Icons Component

## Overview
Simple, symbolic visuals used to communicate meaning quickly and support recognition across an interface. Icons enhance usability when used with labels, reinforce actions, and help reduce cognitive load in dense layouts.

## Complete documentation, see: https://guides.muibook.com/icons

## Usage Guidelines
- Use icons to support labels or actions, not replace them.
- Ideal for reinforcing meaning in buttons, menus, or navigation.
- Ensure consistency in size, style, and alignment across the product.
- Avoid using icons without clear meaning or universal recognition.
