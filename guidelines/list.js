## Overview
Used to display related items in a clear, readable sequence. Lists can be ordered (numbered) to suggest priority or sequence, or unordered (bulleted) for grouped information without hierarchy.

## Complete documentation, see: https://guides.muibook.com/list

## Usage
- Use ordered lists when the order or steps matter (e.g. instructions)
- Use unordered lists for grouped or related items without a set order
- Keep items concise and consistent in structure for scanability
- Avoid using lists for complex content — consider a table or grid instead

## Anatomy

- Can be ordered (numbered) or unordered (bulleted).
