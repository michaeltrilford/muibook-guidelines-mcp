  content: `# Muibook Guidelines: Rule

## Overview
A visual divider used to separate content either horizontally or vertically. Rules help structure layouts, guide the eye, and signal shifts in content or grouping without relying on additional components or heavy visuals.

## Complete documentation, see: https://guides.muibook.com/rule

## Usage
- Use horizontal rules to separate sections or create visual breaks in flows.
- Use vertical rules to divide elements within a row or dense layout.
- Align with spacing and layout conventions to maintain visual rhythm.
- Avoid using rules purely for decoration—rules should support clarity and structure.

## Anatomy

- **Orientation** – Horizontal or vertical.
- **Thickness** – Adjust to match visual hierarchy and context.
- **Color/Style** – Use neutral tones for subtle separation or stronger tones for emphasis.

## Compositions
Showcases actual use cases, demonstrating how the component fits into real-world UI scenarios.

- **Card Separators**: Horizontal rules used to separate sections within a card.
- **Form Layouts**: Vertical rules dividing related input groups in multi-column forms.
- **Content Panels**: Horizontal rules visually break up dense information flows.

## Related Components
- **Stack**: Arranges children in a horizontal or vertical flow with consistent spacing.
- **Grid**: Arranges children into columns for structured layouts.
- **Divider**: Sometimes synonymous with Rule; used interchangeably in layouts where semantic distinction is not critical.`,
